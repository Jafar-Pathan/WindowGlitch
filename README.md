# WindowGlitch
A script in java to simulate classic window glitch  using javafx.

It creates an object of stage each time window is dragged. Resulting a glitch like condition. This is version 1 with no control just simple drag and create glitch.
There is a version 2 with more control over functionality.

Happy coding....s
